🚗 Car Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI + Python)
📊 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a high-end car dataset using Power BI for interactive data visualization and Python for data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal was to uncover key automotive insights across brands, engine types, fuel usage, and car performance metrics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Power BI – for dashboard creation and visual storytelling

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – for EDA and data cleaning

Jupyter Notebook – for preprocessing and Python visuals

Data Source – Car specifications and performance dataset (including price, speed, engine, brand, fuel type)

📌 Key Insights
Brand Distribution: Nissan, Volkswagen, and Porsche dominate the dataset in terms of car count.

Sum of Prices: Total market value of the cars analyzed is 167 million.

Fuel Type Trends: BMWs are predominantly petrol-based (870), with electric and hybrid models also present.

Top Fastest Cars: Highlighted cars include Bugatti Chiron, Chiron Sport, and Bolide.

Engine Performance: V8 engines lead in average total speed, followed by V6.

Brand Comparison: BMW vs MERCEDES engine breakdown provided (I4, I6, Electric, etc.).

📌 Notes
Visuals and data are intended for educational and portfolio purposes.
